## Clickbait Lessons


### Inspiration: 
As a parent, it can be hard to moderate and limit what your child is exposed to on the internet and this issue is highlighted by the fact that videos for children have visually gotten weirder and weirder. The article “Something is wrong on the internet” by James Bridle discusses Youtube videos targeted for children that have hidden messages, inappropriate content or are using copyrighted material. The child innocently browsing the Internet thinks they are clicking on a video of their favourite cartoon, but end up viewing a Disney Princess pointing a firearm at a Paw Patrol character. Bridle also uses examples of videos that have since been removed form the web to exemplify the violating of copyright policies on Youtube. The danger with this whole copyright violation thing is that one never knows what will pop up on their screen. This situation allows children to be blindly exposed to undesired content. 

### The Game
In this game, you will experience a day at work as a moderator teaching an AI to recognize thumbnails coming from non-official Youtube Kids channels or "regular Youtube" channels. Videos targeting a young audience have gotten more and more creative over the years and evil-minded companies have started taking advantage of that phenomenon; using the same type of visuals to lure children into clicking on their videos.

### How to Play: 
A subreddit called r/Elsagate actually inspired me to go on a hunt for weird youtube video targeting children. Now my Youtube's reccomended are full of wierd Peppa Pig videos...
Click on the thumbnail you think it isn't from an official Youtube Channel. A ''wrong'' thumbnail would be: violating copyright regulations, displaying cartoon characters in inapropriate situations, making a collage of tv characters, etc. If you guess wrong, evil companies will keep on making money from that video, if you guess right the AI's learning progress grows. The visuals of the game are intentionally light and colourful to be in the theme of kid stuff and a little robot dances when you guess right.
