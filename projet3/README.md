## DID
According to WebMD, Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is “a mental process which produces a lack of connection in a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of identity, it is believed to be a mechanism to help the individual cope with the trauma they experienced.” It can present itself in many different ways - in as many ways as there are people suffering from DID.

Essentially it disrupts the personality from integrating fully. So instead of having one fully formed personality, a child will grow up having multiple self-states. These self states are known as alters. They develop as separate people. They have their own memories, their own experiences and make their own decisions on their life based on those memories. They also have different religions, different tastes in food, different reactions to medicine, different sexual orientation, different genders and things like that. In order to develop DID, 3 things need to be present: disorganized attachment with the primary caregiver, inherent ability to dissociate and repeated childhood trauma.

### The Experience
Alters is the story of a psychology student interviewing Margaret, the host of a system with multiple personalities. Along the way the player also meets James and Sophia, both alters of the system. Each alters has a specific vibe to them to visually represent their personalities.
I would've loved to incorporate more alters and extend the interview, but I feel like it would've made the game feel too heavy for nothing. With 3 alters and just a couple of questions. I was able to get my point across just fine.

### Inspiration
Now I'm aware that I won't be evaluated based on the research I did, and I'm 100% fine with that haha.

The primary thing that pushed me into doing this ''game'' is the fact that for years I wanted to become a psychologist. I actually studied social sciences back in CEGEP, thinking I would later study at Udem in psychology and live a long and prosperous life. But my aspirations have since changed and now look at me, creating memes-inspired mini-games. I'm on top of my game.

What also inspired this experience is a video I watched a couple of months back from Anthony Padilla. In his video, Anthony interviews 3 people living with DID, one of them running a channel called DissociaDID and since then, I fell into a rabbit hole of DID videos. I watched a ton of videos from different people and found out that the DID community on Youtube is such a great ressource for anyone (like me) who want to know what DID is. I find this subject so interesting and I think everyone should know about that disorder that affects more than 1% of the population (which is kind of a lot). 

For a year now I've been coding games and fun stuff, this time around I wanted to try something different. Something that did not require any skill: an experience you can simply sit back and enjoy while learning about such a misunderstood disorder that is no where near how it is represented in the medias (think of the movie Split).
