    <h1><em><font size='9'>Disclaimer</font></em> <br><br> Dissociative Identity Disorder is a complex mental illness associated with overwhelming experiences ,<br> traumatic events and/or abuse during childhood. It is not a disorder to take lightly.<br> <br> The goal of this experience is to raise awareness about DID. <br> The delays between switches have been shortened for the sake of this project. <br><br> Every person experiences DID in their own way, each of them as valid as the other. </h1> <br> <h2>I do not consider myself a professional in anyway regarding this disorder, however the DID community on Youtube is a wonderful ressource for anyone wanting to learn more about it</h2>
